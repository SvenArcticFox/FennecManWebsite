<p>
  Please excuse my horrible art skills.
</p>
<p>
  Fennec Man's abilities include being able to broadcast 5G or any other wireless
  standard (hence the Wi-Fi network), having super strength, super speed and,
  having the ability to scream really loudly which deafens and confuses his
  enemies.
</p>
<p>
  Fennec Man broadcasts these wireless standards through his ears. Inside of
  his ears, there are nano modems that are extremely tiny with nano wires acting
  as antennas. Fennec man can upgrade these technologies as they advance by using
  a device that he invented that fits around the ears. This device contains a
  syringe like device that injects the new technologies and antennas into his ears.
  This device also removes the old technologies and antennas from his ears so that
  they can by discarded.

<h2>Fennec Man Ven Diagram and Story</h2>
<img src="Ven Diagram.jpg" alt="Ven Diagram.jpg" width="500" height="400">
<p>Before continuing, the story does get dark and involves nazis.</p>
<p>Fennec Man, or Jean de Marseille, was a French soldier during World War II.
  He was originally conscripted to the army in 1939, when France declared war
  on Germany. His family was also conscripted to the army. Marseille was sent to
  the Maginot Line, which was a line of forts that stretched along the border
  between France and Germany. After 6 months of both sides preparing, Germany invades
  Belgium and shortly after takes Paris. Marseille's family is captured or killed
  and Marseille flees to French Algeria. Marseille quickly finds himself gathering
  intelligence for the resistance and in the process of navigating the desert,
  he was bitten by a fennec fox that the nazis were experimenting on to intercept
  communications from the resistance. Marseille quickly finds himself in a new form,
  looking more like a buff anthropomorphic fennec fox with a suit that resembles
  the French Tri color. Marseille quickly finds out that he is able to change between
  the two forms. Eventually he finds, in fennec form, when out in the field, the resistance
  base was able to hear nazi communications more clearly. Marseille also found out that
  he was able to interfere with enemy radio equipment. He finds out when finding
  an enemy controlled radio station, screaming was able to deafen and confuse the
  soldiers. After the war, Marseille invented the device that can upgrade his
  ears with new wireless technologies.</p>
